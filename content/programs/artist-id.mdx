description: A unified certification system to help cities identify and support their creative communities

**53,000 artists applied for 89 affordable units in East Harlem**

## The Problem

NYC's creative economy generates $110B annually and employs 274,000 workers, yet the city has no unified way to identify or support them.

Artists must re-prove their eligibility for every program—from housing and workspace to grants—each with different criteria and paperwork. The demand is real: when El Barrio Artspace opened 89 affordable units, 53,000 artists applied.

The infrastructure to serve them is not.

## The Solution

Create a single Artist ID recognized across city agencies. Certify once, unlock benefits everywhere—modeled on the city's MWBE certification system.

DCLA would set the criteria and make certification decisions (as they know the artist community). SBS provides the infrastructure like the portal, registry, interagency data-sharing (as they know how to run certification at scale).

## Who Qualifies

- 12+ months active artistic practice
- Self-identified art form (no institutional gatekeeping)
- Artistic practice as core part of vocation or life's work (even if not primary income source)
- Connection to cultural workforce: earns from practice, works in arts/culture sector, or contributes substantially through unpaid or community-based work
- Peer attestations from other artists or cultural workers

## Immediate Benefits

### Housing & Workspace

- Eligibility/preference in selected affordable housing lotteries
- Landlord incentives for leasing studios to certified artists
- Priority access to city-owned studios

### Economic Support

- Reduced city fees for artist enterprises
- Common eligibility for stabilization grants
- Targeted tax relief and fee waivers

### City Contracts & Employment

- Preference for city cultural contracts and employment
- Public art, commissions, teaching artist roles
- Agency creative work opportunities

## Implementation

### Phase 1 (Year 1)

Executive order, interagency MOUs, pilot with 2–3 programs. Focus on AREA employment, affordable housing lotteries, and city-owned studio access.

### Phase 2 (Year 2)

Council legislation to codify definitions and authorize programs. Tax relief and broader benefit rollout.

### Phase 3 (Years 3–4)

Full rollout, online portal, agency integration across all city programs.

**Cost:** $3–5M over three years (comparable to running fragmented eligibility systems)

## Built on Proven Infrastructure

The Artist ID follows the same cost and registry logic as NYC's successful MWBE certification: one robust vetting process, then a centralized database that all agencies can draw from instead of recreating eligibility checks for every program.

| Aspect | MWBE (Existing) | Artist ID (Proposed) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Who issues | NYC SBS, Mayor's Office of M/WBEs | NYC DCLA, with interagency MOUs |
| One-time vetting | 51% ownership + 1-year operation | 12+ months practice + vocation claim |
| Central registry | SBS-run registry agencies rely on | City-run registry HPD, NYCEDC, DOF use |
| Portability | Across city contracts, procurement | Across housing, workspace, tax, grants |

## Certified Artist Enterprises

Beyond individual certification, the Artist ID system includes entity-level certification for artist-run businesses and organizations.

### Eligibility

- At least 50% ownership and voting control by Certified Artists
- Primary activity is creation, production, or presentation of artistic/cultural work
- Includes studios, collectives, galleries, labels, presses, creative production companies
- Any legal form: sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership, corporation, cooperative, nonprofit, or future Artist Corporation

### Benefits

Certified Artist Enterprises gain priority access to subsidized studios, city contracts, tax relief programs, and stabilization grants—treating artist-run businesses as the cultural workers they are, not hobbyists.

## Equity and Access

A certification system only works if it reaches the artists who need it most. The outreach strategy actively counters barriers for vulnerable creative workers—immigrants, disabled artists, BIPOC practitioners, and those working in informal settings.

### Key Commitments

- Partner with cultural organizations, mutual aid networks, and immigrant-serving groups for outreach
- Mobile-friendly portal available in at least 5 languages with in-person assistance options
- Collect and publish anonymized demographic data to monitor equity outcomes
- Community advisory group with artists from underrepresented communities

## Future Alignment with Artist Corporations

The Artist ID lays groundwork for potential Artist Corporation (A-Corp) adoption. If New York pursues an A-Corp statute, the ID provides a clear, scalable way to identify which artists and artist-run entities qualify.

A future A-Corp statute could simply state that Artist Corporations may be formed by Certified Artists or groups where the majority are Certified Artists—avoiding the need to redefine "who is an artist" in statute.

With the ID system in place, when A-Corp legislation passes, the City would already have a scalable identification system, a portfolio of benefits, and outcome data to inform statewide policy.

## Why Now

This delivers on housing and cultural worker commitments with existing tools—no new bureaucracy, just coordination.

Artists are already applying in overwhelming numbers. The city should create the infrastructure to serve them systematically.
