title: Artist Corporations make creative freedom real
slug: law
description: A new legal structure designed specifically for creative people and artistic enterprises
---

## Overview

The Colorado Artist Corporation Act (CO-ACA) creates a new type of limited liability company specifically designed for artists and creative enterprises. This legislation addresses the unique needs of creative people that existing business structures fail to serve.

**48% of Americans report a personal creative practice**

## Why We Need A-Corps

Today's business structures—LLCs, C-Corps, S-Corps—were built for traditional businesses with traditional assumptions about value creation. Creative practices don't fit neatly into these boxes.

The result is that most artists, musicians, writers, and creators either operate informally (leaving themselves exposed) or squeeze into ill-fitting legal structures that don't serve their needs and aren't easy to understand.

When creative people represented a small fraction of the population, this was excusable. But this is no longer the case. Creative work is becoming an increasingly important part of our economy.

## What Makes A-Corps Different

### Artistic Mission at the Core

A-Corps are required to have a stated artistic mission. This mission can take priority over financial objectives, be equal to them, or have any other specified relationship to financial goals.

### Artist Ownership and Control

Artists must own at least 51% of voting control. This ensures creative people maintain decision-making power even as they accept investment or bring in other stakeholders.

### Flexible Ownership Structures

A-Corps can structure ownership in ways that make sense for creative work:

- Pro rata ownership based on number of members
- Ownership based on capital contributions (including intellectual property)
- Custom ownership percentages
- Separation of economic rights from governance rights

### Intellectual Property Protection

The law includes sophisticated provisions for handling intellectual property:

- IP can be contributed as in-kind capital
- Clear rules for IP created during membership
- Reversionary rights upon dissolution (IP goes back to artists, not investors)
- Flexible treatment of royalties and revenue participation

### Simplified Governance

A-Corps don't require the formal governance structures of traditional corporations. The law explicitly states that informal practices—like not holding annual meetings or keeping detailed minutes—won't be held against A-Corps.

### Multiple Forms of Capital

A-Corps can accept investment in forms that make sense for creative work:

- Grants and refundable grants
- Revenue participation rights
- Royalty participation
- Traditional equity
- Convertible instruments

### Public Benefit Option

A-Corps can elect to become "Public Benefit Artist Corporations," committing to creating public benefits beyond their artistic mission while maintaining tax advantages and legal protections.

## Current Status

We're working to pass this legislation in Colorado, where we have:

- A completed first draft of the law
- A fiscal and economic analysis by a former budget director
- A bill sponsor: Senator Jeff Bridges of Colorado's 4th District
- Working relationships with the Governor's office and key stakeholders

The bill will be introduced in the 2026 legislative session in Colorado. We're also working with other states and nations interested in adopting similar legislation.
