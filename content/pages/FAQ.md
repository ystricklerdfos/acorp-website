# Artist Corporations: Frequently Asked Questions

## Origins & Purpose

**Where did the idea for A-Corps come from?**

The idea came from personal frustration while trying to design a legal entity for a writer collective project I'm part of. It was expensive just to have a structure we understood and that reflected some fundamental basics of how we wanted to work together. I knew many others who had similar experiences. Why not make a new structure anyone could easily and affordably use, creating better economic outcomes, shared resources, and a stronger ownership foundation for all?

As the son of a musician who never quite made it, I've known the gap between cultural value and economic power since childhood. I've dedicated my professional life to bettering it, from cofounding and leading Kickstarter to cofounding The Creative Independent.

**How big is the creative workforce today?**

- 48% of Americans report a personal creative practice, like writing, painting, or music
- 40% of Millennials and Gen Z are "very interested" in a full-time career as a content creator
- 75% of them view it as a "viable career"
- Just 13% of artists earn a full-time living from their work
- Creative people are three times more likely than others to be gig workers and have multiple jobs

**What's the gap you're trying to address?**

There's a gap between time spent by audiences and the economic reality for the people making that work. People spend enormous amounts of time watching, scrolling, and being inspired by creative and cultural work. Some artists and content creators become wealthy, but the overwhelming majority do not. The love on-stage and on-screen does not result in economic or professional stability for creative people.

## The Journey

**How long has this been in development?**

Over the past 18 months, what started as an idea has slowly transformed into the first steps of reality. That creative and emotional journey has brought us into close contact with fellow artists and creators, creative workers and leaders, legal and corporate experts, and political and community conveners.

**Why Colorado?**

After the TED talk in April 2024, we began to hear from people interested in learning more. Quite a few were located in Colorado — a state with:
- A history of embracing new corporate forms (PBCs and co-ops)
- One of the highest numbers of artists per capita of any state in America
- The incoming Sundance Film Festival, as part of a project to make Colorado "the creative state"

We found an exceptional, welcoming community open to showing us the ropes and engaging in deep conversations about how to work together.

**Do you have experience with legislation?**

This work is new to us. Before this, I had no experience in laws or lobbying beyond what I've read in books and seen in movies. But I've been surprised to find I enjoy this work. It's meaningful to engage in the democratic process, especially on behalf of our creative community.

## Current Status

**Where are you in the legislative process?**

Thanks to the support of many lawyers, political leaders, and arts and culture leaders we collaborated with, we now have:
- The first draft of a law completed, which will be publicly shared soon
- A sponsor for our bill: Senator Jeff Bridges, Chair of the Joint Budget Committee in the Colorado Senate
- A plan to introduce that bill as legislation in the 2026 Colorado Legislative Session
- A fiscal and economic analysis completed by a former budget director
- Working relationships with the Governor's office and other key stakeholders

**Is Colorado the only state involved?**

While Colorado has been our primary focus, other states, nations, government agencies, and universities have also reached out. Other bills based on the Colorado legislation are beginning to go into motion in other US states. There is organic interest among policymakers in creating more systematic and economic support for their creative communities.

## The Bigger Picture

**Will passing a law solve everything?**

No. Passing legislation is the initial change we've focused on, but legislation alone won't solve the challenges creative people face.

A law can make a better structure, but it doesn't help creative people become more economically successful or educated, nor does it make them more powerful and capable on their own.

This is why we've expanded our focus to include administrative infrastructure and practical tools beyond just the legal structure itself.

**What should we expect in the next 3-5 years?**

Even if every one of our 2026 initiatives is successful, we do not expect to see instant change. This work will take time.

The immediate outcomes will be about increasing efficiency and understanding more than creating a totally new economic reality for creative people. Instead, we first must create new baselines to build on and educate ourselves from, and establish ourselves more clearly as a constituency whose needs must be considered locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.

In the next three to five years we hope to see a rising tide of education, understanding, and resources shifting into the creative sphere, matched with increasing care and appreciation for the importance of creative people to our economies and communities at large.

As creative people become more comfortable financially (in both senses of the word), we'll see an increase in support flowing to us from investors, government agencies, and the public at large.

**Who funds this work?**

The Artist Corporations Foundation is supported by multiple arts philanthropic organizations, including the Rainin Foundation and unnamed donors. We'll announce more funders and support in the new year.

**How many people are interested in A-Corps?**

More than 4,000 artists and creators have signed up to become an A-Corp, and thousands more have watched the TED talk, are following our journey, and will join this movement as our impact grows.

This feels less like building something from scratch and more like giving form to something that already wants to exist.
